    <p>Hi there!  My name is Chris Ledford, I am very excited about starting this journey to learning more about coding!  My main goal for this course is to change careers into the tech field and contribute more for my family.  I currently work for Sprouts as a Scan Coordinator, and just started my 8th year of employment there.  I make sure all the prices are correct and that everything rings up correctly at the register.</p>
      
    <p>I have always liked and been drawn to computers, and I have built every desktop I have ever owned, with the exception of my first one which was built by my father.  My father has worked in the industry for many years and has been instrumental in pushing me and allowing me to finally pursue something I love.</p>

    <p>In my free time I like to collect coins, play disc golf, and do just about anything with my wife, daughter and our dogs.</p>
